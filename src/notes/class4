Polymorphism
	Method overloading
	Method overriding

Abstract classes

Abstract class is a class whose object can't be created
Abstract class can have abstract methods

Interfaces

Interface has only abstract methods


Base class reference can be equated to child class objects
Interface reference can be equated to implementation objects

An interface can be implemented by any class
A class can implement multiple interfaces
---------------------
final keyword : 
If a class is final, there are no child classes for this class
If a method is final, a child class can't override that method
If an instance variable is final, then the value of that instance variable can't be changed

class Fruit{
	final float price;
	public final float getPrice(){
		return price;
	}

}
class Orange extends Fruite{

}

final class Apple extends Fruit{

}
--------

static 

fields with static keyword are shared for all the objects of same type
static methods can be invoked from class directly
