Common operations with files/database
-----

CREATE
UPDATE
DELETE
READ
SEARCH

----Challenges with accessing files

Direct data manipulation in files is not safe
Inserting data in between means rewrite the whole file
Deleting a record in between also means rewrite the whole file
New records in file also meaning opening the file for edit and updating the end
Scanning for records in file is sequential
There is no normalization or redundancy removal on files

----Steps for working with Databases in Java---

Create the Connection --- Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(xxxx);
Create a Statement ---- Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
Execute the Query on Statement - ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("");
Close all the ResultSet, Statement, Connection
